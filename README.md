# Detour: Avoid closed roads before they ruin your ride.
Detour is designed to help cyclists avoid closed roads. Current mapping software only shows closed roads for A-B navigation, rather than for a user defined route. Road side diversions are designed for cars, with no consideration of hills/road size - both of which have significant impact on cyclists. By pre-planning detours, an optimal route can be found, with no on-bike frustation!
